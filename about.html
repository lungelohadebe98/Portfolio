    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Johannesburg, South Africa</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        My Name is Lungelo Hadebe, I am from a small town called Memel. I have
        always showed interest in Technology but due to the lack of resources
        from our town, I could not get more knowledge or try to persue a career
        in Tech so instead when I got to university I tried to study Bachelor of
        commerce but could not obtain my degree on my final year due to
        financial difficulties, nonetheles my love for sofware development has
        always been there.
        <br />
        <br />
        My passion for computers only intensified. Despite the lack of resources
        and opportunities in my town, I devoured every piece of information I
        could find online, teaching myself programming languages and delving
        into the basics of software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then embarked on a journey to turn my dreams into reality. I spent
        countless nights honing my skills, working on personal projects, and
        participating in online coding communities. The more I learn, the more I
        yearn to make a mark in the tech world.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hope as time passes, my skills will blossom, and my confidence soares.
        Become an integral part of the development team, contributing innovative
        solutions and bringing fresh perspectives to the table.
